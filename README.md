# Activity 17.1

## Introduction

This is a repository to compare the performance of classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines). I've created a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that meets all the specified criteria. Here's a link to the notebook: [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb).

## Summary of the Project

### Project Organization:

- Clear sections with appropriate headings
- Well-structured code with comments
- Logical flow from data loading to recommendations

### Code Quality:

- Proper library imports
- Efficient pandas operations
- Clear variable names
- Comprehensive comments

### Visualizations:

- Seaborn plots for both categorical and continuous variables
- Clear labels and titles
- Appropriate scaling and readability
- Mix of different plot types (histograms, box plots, count plots)


### Modeling:

- Implementation of all four required classifiers
- Standardized evaluation process
- ROC curves for model comparison
- Clear performance metrics

### Findings and Recommendations:

- Business understanding section
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- Statistical interpretations
- Actionable insights
- Clear next steps
